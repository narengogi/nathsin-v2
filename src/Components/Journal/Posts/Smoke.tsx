                I was 6, and amma, akka and I went to my grandparents house for the first time that I remember (I have
                no previous recollection of the place prior to that). I remember soiling my sandals in a glob of buffalo
                shit when I tried to cut in through a shortcut. My grandad had the huge ancestral house demolished and
                had a smaller modern house built. His reasoning being that not many people were going to stay there now
                anyways, but this gave us a huge area to play around and grow vegetables in, there’s this one guava tree
                that my mom planted on her marriage day, and I inscribed my name with a chisel on it’s largest branch,
                and I always see that it is still there. Anyways, my grandfathers house is the most calming place to my
                mind. There’s marble seats built into the walls on the outside, as is the tradition for nearly all the
                houses there. For people to sit and hangout in the early mornings and evenings. The entire street comes
                to life in the evenings particularly. There’s different groups with different topics for discussion, and
                we children would fleet from one end to the other, snipping snacks here and there, like hummingbirds on
                the move. We’d catch rats and fling them by the tail into the central water storage lake, a few yards
                from our house.

                It was not till much later that I realised, that everyone in the street was more or less related by
                blood, if you look back a couple of generations. The village is segmented in parts, the places where the
                farmers/land-owners lived was the largest and most spacious one. There was a muslim settlement at the
                start of the village, by the village arch. The Christian settlement is one the opposite side of the main
                road. The farmer settlement is all the way inside. There are two huge rathams in the village, signifying
                it’s opulence and wealth. I still have no clue, for what festivals they are taken out, though I vaguely
                remember taking part in one of the processions.

                My grandmom would feed us three cousins sambhar and omlettes from the same plate. That’s the most
                amazing part of my life, and I’ll never forget it. We’d make french fries, and I’d eat them with my
                grandads machine forceps, wait eagerly while grandma made instant noodles, warmed the milk, and we’d go
                out sit on the guava trees branches and greet everyone passing by on the street. Go to the neighbours
                and watch them milk the buffaloes, grind some spices, light the clay oven and wait for water to heat up.
                Pluck the amlas, pull the leaves from the gorintaku plants, collect the chillies for the dinner. Water
                the terrace and the floors to prepare them for the night. In the night we’d turn on the radio or the TV,
                and listen to the news.
