                I cannot clearly define myself. The conflict and the resulting uncertainty arises from the
                incompatibility of the long term agenda with what appears to be the most reasonable thing to do at the
                present moment with the available inputs. But if in pursuit of the required inputs (Which I must say is
                a necessary and useful thing to do with your time) one does not employ the inputs he is already in
                possession of, the efficacy of such a system is worrisome and not just that, such a process also
                represents a distressing divorce from reality. Now I see clearly.

                I realise, that as an individual, my attention span is my most valuable asset, for the last two weeks
                I’ve not done anything I can sell as having spent the time wisely. In fact it isn’t even that. The last
                two weeks have just slipped from under my feet and I can’t seem to remember how that time was spent, or
                recall any worthwhile discussion that I’d want to remember after a few months as well. Wait wait,
                scratch all that, this contributes little to the discussion, what I really wanted to resolve here is,
                how the heart has been able to get away with wasting all that time. This represents in my understanding
                a death of conscious thought. Which is a terrible terrible thing, for there is nothing in this world not
                achieved through conscious thought that stays with you for long. What could be a solution?
