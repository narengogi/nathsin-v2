                the ideas reaching the most abstract layer, there’s no thread attached that I could use to trace their
                origins. The chemicals conspire to push ahead what could potentially satisfy their collective needs (in
                groups).

                Meditation never helps, I find locking in the latest idea at hand and starting work on it allows me to
                judge it’s priority and then rearrange the tasks, noting them down and then ranking them also helps.

            <div className='para'> I’m working on a fun project these days, this has been on my mind for a bit. I’ll be
                mapping as much of the data about me and my interactions that are recorded digitally as possible. The
                idea is to link them to generate insights. Quite a few interesting challenges there, I’ll update with a
                blog post once done if time permits. There’s another smaller project I want to be doing.
