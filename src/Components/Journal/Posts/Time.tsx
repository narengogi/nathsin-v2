            <div className='para'>I’m losing the edge I had over people of my generation. I can’t afford to dilly-dally
                and waste my time over inconsequential matters. I have to be clinical. I often get paranoid over the
                concept of time, maybe time is my paranoia, I’ll have to be wise, ration it, if we are to achieve our
                goals.

                Yes, like you, I also ask myself about whom I refer to with collective verbs like “we and us” while
                making these journal entries. It’s just me, but from a different time-frame of my life. Arising from the
                assumption that I’m the only person who’ll ever be reminiscing over these entries. But making entries,
                without realizing the value of lessons learnt everyday would be a futile exercise. Effectively implying
                from general reasoning that I go over the entries at regular intervals. The problem with a plan like
                that being the stinging pain associated with looking back at hurtful memories, mainly the choices in
                life made without considering the consequences.
            </div>
            <div className='para'>I realise, as I’ve mentioned once before, that my journal entries almost always lack
                any mention of day to day occurrences or descriptions of perspective altering experiences. They are
                almost always monotonous soliloquies in philosophy, that becomes hard to comprehend, even to me, as time
                unburdens the weight carried by words in ink.
            </div>
            <div className='para'>I’ve thought about it for quite a while, and the reason that these entries lack any
                mention of the events in my life is that, within a short span of an exchange or an experience, it would
                be impossible/incorrect to judge the effect it carries forward into the future. If the future were truly
                predictable, wouldn’t that make us all give up, realising the futility of our actions, how in the end it
                would not matter at all. But this kind of talk, in my experience, apart from offering momentary comfort,
                adds no more value to our existence, than assuming that life is truly random. The latter proposition
                being more dangerous as a thought than the former, For if the actions of our present and past have no
                effect on the future, why would we bother at all!
            </div>
            <div className='para'>The answer I believe lies in treading the middle line. Truly believing in the fact
                that we have control, and are responsible, more than we would like to admit to ourselves, that where we
                are to today is a direct consequence of our past, and where we’ll be tomorrow, one combinedly of the
                past and the present.
            </div>
            <div className='para'>I’ve known myself to make decisions swayed emotionally. Like when I erase memories
                that arise from regretful decisions, like when I choose to do things just to prove people wrong. These
                are what contribute to the unpredictability of our future, these are decisions I should consciously
                avoid.
