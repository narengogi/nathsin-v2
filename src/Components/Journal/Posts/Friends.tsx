                It’s been an eternity since I’ve actually had a truly open conversation with anyone. It appears that the
                only person I ever turn to when I’m feeling low is myself. I’m not yet sure if this is a good thing. In
                all obviousness, it appears to me to be a precursor to developing a narcissistic mindset. I’ve always
                been of the opinion that having a few good friends to share feelings without the fear of being judged is
                a good thing.

            <div className='para'>
                I’ve never given it much thought, but on better introspection, I know that I have no such friends.
                Honestly, I’ve arrived at this situation through pre-planned actions, the consequences of which I fully
                knew. When I was in middle school, I used to trust everyone blindly. Tell my friends my secrets, others
                secrets and my fears and my feelings. Only to have people take advantage and mock and use them against
                me. Nothing changed for a long while, but through High school, I closed myself off. Trusting only a few,
                but even then, the same happened.

            <div className='para'> Now I’m like a broken puzzle(no filmy exaggeration tho). A few pieces of me lie each
                with different sets of people I’ve known over the years. People only see the sides of me that I show
                them. I evade questions on my past like a cow on Indian streets. No kidding, I think this is what is
                best for a man. To be truly independent and closed off.
                But the only thing lacking is a solid review system.
