                I often think about starving to death, or about how that act would symbolise the supremacy of the mind.
                But if life is meaningless, so is death. The conflict must continue. Systems rearrange to serve superior
                memes, rules are drawn to explain them, systems of formal logic emerge, and the conflicts emerge again,
                because the systems are impure now, the subsystems contradict each other.

            <div className='para'>
                The layers of abstraction that were built in my mind on top of the axiom that everything is
                for the multiplication and survival of the gene (as a set of instructions) crumbled one day. Because ME as an
                entity is far removed from the gene. I’m a meme, the one that translates between memes and genes.
            </div>
            <div className='para'>
                So let’s put aside people who kill themselves because survival is too hard for
                them. What about people who kill themselves when everything is provided for? If the goal is to find
                meaning and in not finding it, the meme
                terminates the host it operates on, but it implants itself in others, by having them reason about why it
                terminated itself. The meme continues surviving by having asserted its primacy.
