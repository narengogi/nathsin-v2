                My thathayya killed himself last December. He was 75. There’s this story about how he used to be pretty
                normal until one day in his 30’s he spent way too much time at the vallakaadu. My parents
                and the relatives got it registered as a natural death, as if there is no honour in killing yourself.
                They did it to save themselves from the guilt of having let it happen. I knew he’d been very depressed
                since ammammas death. I keep thinking that nothing made sense to him anymore. But I don’t know what had
                changed for him in those 8 years for this to happen.

                I often think about starving to death, or about how that act would symbolise the supremacy of the mind.
                But if life is meaningless, so is death. The conflict must continue. Systems rearrange to serve superior
                memes, rules are drawn to explain them, systems of formal logic emerge, and the conflicts emerge again,
                because the systems are impure now, the subsystems contradict each other.

                The day I read Camus, I knew that my system of formal logic was shattered by a spear
                of proof. The layers of abstraction that were built in my mind on top of the axiom that everything is
                for the multiplication and survival of the gene (as a set of instructions) crumbled. Because ME as an
                entity is far removed from the gene. I’m a meme, the one that translates between memes and genes.

                So let’s put aside people who kill themselves because survival looks too hard for
                them. What about people who kill themselves when everything is provided for? The meme continues
                surviving by having asserted its primacy. If the goal is to find meaning and in not finding it, the meme
                terminates the host it operates on, but it implants itself in others, by having them reason about why it
                terminated itself. The meme has won.
